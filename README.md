## About

Strong focus on Python backend development, microservices, and API design, with experience building robust platforms, automation frameworks, and production-grade systems.

Currently, I focus on developing automation and production pipeline tools for Digital Content Creation (DCC) environments. I have worked both within organizations and on independent projects, delivering workflow-oriented solutions that are actively used in real production. I am passionate about turning complex technical processes into stable, well-tested systems that teams can rely on.
